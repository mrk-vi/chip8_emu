# Chip8 Emulator in Rust

This is a project that i started only to make practice with Rust
and with the world of emulators.

Chip8 is suggested as a starting point when you want to learn how 
to write an emulator.

Thanks to aquova, who has writed a very clear [guide](https://github.com/aquova/chip8-book).
I readed that and I started to implement it in Rust.
To anyone who is interested I suggest that to.
